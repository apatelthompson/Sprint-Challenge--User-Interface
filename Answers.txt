If you were to describe semantic HTML to the next cohort of students, what would you say?
Semantic HTML is like a 2 in 1 - it does its job in creating structure (eg. presentation guidance) but it also provides a powerful roadmap in giving context  (eg. the meaning of what it is). Eg you could use a <div> to mark a section (and sometimes that’s all you need, to keep it simple and general) but using something like <main> helps to understand that this section is the main bit of the site. That also helps when indexing the site and potentially pulling out some parts and not others.

2. Name two big differences between display: block;anddisplay: inline;.
1) Display: block can change margin, padding properties while display:inline you can’t (unless you use display: inline-block)
2) Display: block always starts a new line while display:inline elements don’t

3. What are the 4 areas of the box model?
Content, Padding, Border, Margin

4. While using flexbox, what axis does the following property work on:align-items: center?
Cross-axis (assuming flex-direction is row)

5. Explain why git is valuable to a team of developers.
Collaboration: allows a team of developers to work on the same project using branching which makes it fast and easy
Speed: Everyone works on a full version of the repo and issues on one doesn’t impact others from making progress
Version control: Can track and manage changes more effectively
Flexibility:  Creates a culture of faster, smaller changes
